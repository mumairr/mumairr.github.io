            <p>In 2022, I won this project in my freelance career to build a map based GIS solution for farmers, which
                would allow farmers to add up their information / data about their surveys of the field spatially.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Rather than going through hectic manual process or including or excluding the fields, farmers would be
                able to do the same over a spatial map served on a web gis solution on the fly with only a few clicks of
                the mouse. A spatial database was designed to handle the requests of the farmers alongwith their own non
                spatial information embedded into the system.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a freelance project that I won over Upwork as a freelancer and developed the portal from scratch
                to top & deployed it over AWS servers.</p>
