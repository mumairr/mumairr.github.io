            <p>In 2011, I was tasked to develop a desktop based application for on the fly display of results for constituencies of Pakistan.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Arc based Engine was used to render spatial datasets on C# based desktop application that handled the MySql database on the back-end and displayed election results on the app. Results were updated via REST Api at the back-end and dynamically visualized on the fly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I designed, developed and deployed the app. It was written in Visual Studio Code, C# was used to write it up and ran over windows OS based machines.</p>
