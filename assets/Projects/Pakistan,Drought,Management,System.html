        Climate change had its impact globally on all aspects of life. Experts
        across the domain are continually investigating new technologies and
        working practices to keep track of the changes and their associated
        impacts on the enviroment. That's why Pakistan Drought Management System
        is developed, to tie together the newest technologies with expert
        insight to help users run, learn and devise socio economic based
        decisions following affects of climate change.

        The central idea behind PakDMS was to create a platform which could
        host, manage and inform, rather than just store data, putting the user
        in control where user can filter list of inidices based on mutiple
        criteria like geometry (administrative boundary), dates, aggregation to
        be performed etc.

        This was a consultancy project, where IWMI (Inernational Water
        Management) is the client. It was a team effort where indices were
        handled by respective consultants and I was the lead developer for the
        portal. My prime responsibility in the task was to design, develop &
        deploy complete portal on IWMI server, integrate data from python based
        Google Earth Engine codebase, Geo-visualization of the layers, filtering
        etc. User could either preview the layers on the map geologically or
        view its tabular data in the form of graph.

        Portal allows user to switch between themes, uses latest available
        libraries like Antd & Material UI for different components and icons.
