            <p>In 2022, I won this project in my freelance career to build a map based GIS solution for recording Down
                Wind Fun watersport treks, which would allow other users from around the world for browsing the possible
                routes, wind directions etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>DownwindFun helps all watersport lovers to not only discover new downwind locations but also to share
                their favourite downwind locations with fellow downwinder enthusiasts all over the world. Project
                involved allowing users to either browse the available options or draw a new one them self up on a map.
                Openlayers was used as web mapping library, PostgreSQL for handling GIS data and MySQL for handling user
                database. Mapbox was used for 3d view of the browsed options.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a freelance project that I won over Upwork as a freelancer and developed the portal from scratch
                to top & deployed it over hosting server of the client.</p>
