            <p>In 2019, I won this project in my freelance career to build a wordpress website for a US based client
                that would act as their home website</p>
            <br>
            <p>Website delivers information about the products, services and client base for the subject company in
                detailed and elaborative manner</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a freelance project that I won over Upwork as a freelancer and developed the portal from scratch
                to top & deployed it over AWS servers.</p>
