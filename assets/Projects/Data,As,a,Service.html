            <p>In 2022, my companyd desired to build a map based GIS solution for a client, which would allow technicians and engineers to view the spatial SRS data on the fly over the web rather than downloading raw satellite imageries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This helped users in multiple ways: 1) They didn't need to download the imagery on their side avoiding space, bandwith, high-end servers etc. 2) It helped them to view it as soon as data was acquired and available on the server 3) Data was segreggated for multiple users and rules of geo-fencing were applied to keep data for each user intact</p>
            <br>
            <p>I designed, developed and deployed the portal from scratch to top. It was written using all open source libraries and tools & final solution was deployed over data servers.</p>
