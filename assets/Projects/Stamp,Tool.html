            <p>In 2019, I won this project in my freelance career to build a map based GIS solution for a telecom company called ambiflo, which would allow technicians and engineers to add up relevant information & stamp locations for surveys of the field spatially.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Rather than going through hectic manual process of adding up data over csv files, technicians would be
                able to do the same over a spatial map served on a web gis solution on the fly with only a few clicks of
                the mouse. A spatial database was designed to handle the requests of the technicians alongwith their own non
                spatial information embedded into the system and few of the fields controlled via database to avoid errors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a freelance project that I won over Upwork as a freelancer and developed the portal from scratch
                to top & deployed it over AWS servers.</p>
