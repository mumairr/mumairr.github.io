            <p>In 2019, I won this project in my freelance career to build a map based GIS solution for a therapist in
                Belgium, which would allow other therapists to register themself on the map as well as choose their
                specialities & working locations etc. spatially.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Project involved allowing therapists to mark them self up on a map, reverse geocode their location and
                save their speciliaties for others to look for. Main page allowed a user to search for specific
                therapist and book their appointments. Openlayers was used as web mapping library, PostgreSQL for
                handling GIS data and MySQL for handling user database.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was a freelance project that I won over Upwork as a freelancer and developed the portal from scratch
                to top & deployed it over hosting server of the client.</p>
