        This calculator is intended for preliminary estimate purposes only for
        Nassau County, Florida, US. Calculator is provided as a courtesy and can
        be used as a guideline to estimate the approximate amount of Mobility
        Fees that may be due for a given project. There are many factors that
        may affect the total fees. Actual trip generation and Mobility Fees will
        be ultimately determined by the County Development Services.
        Additionally, many developments include multiple uses, and each use
        should be calculated individually and combined for the estimated total
        fee. This calculator does not vest any right or entitlement to the
        calculated fee in any party, and any reliance on such calculated fee is
        at the end userâ€™s sole responsibility and acceptance and acknowledgment

        The prime idea behind NC Mobility Fee Calculator was to create a
        platform which would allow users to calculate their Mobility Fee based
        on the type of property, its Land-use code, what units it offers and
        calculate the the fee dynamically to give an estimate of what the fee
        might be. It takes into account multiple factors like fixed-zone values,
        pass-by-percentage etc. Complex mathematical formulas are implemented at
        the back-end for successful completion of the project and avoid even a
        single digit error.
